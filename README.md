# WasDev.eloping

An attempt at a unique editor that does not feel like a Vim/Emacs/Kakoune/VS... emulation.

## WASD?
Still messing around with keybinds but if you have caps lock mapped to control or a thumb cluster keyboard you can hit the movement keys with one hand without needing to be in a modal editor.

### Ergonomics
Trying to develop keybinds that are based on homerow and comfort.

### Text Editing
I am a big fan of the emacs way of running commands with M-x and figured instead of keybinds, which-key/pop-up menu's and telescope like functionality could be worth focusing on from the start.

### Goal
At this point just fun with building an editor. Most likely something that sort of feels like a lightweight emacs with some niche things added in. Possibly LSP/Syntax highlighting down the line.
